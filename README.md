## 1. Driver View Website
  The Driver View web site is used to help test and tweak our code, and used to help drive team during match. The driver view is a javascript/HTML based viewer of data logs captured from the robot during operation. These data logs are then used to tweak code before, during, and after competition. 

## 2. Main Source Code
![Jazzy](.docs/ReadMeImages/1_5EI2F_7k5zJKVYg_12g5wA.png)
  
  So far we have the majority of functional robot code written in Python.  Here is the Repo if you want to take a gander.
   [here](https://github.com/RobotCasserole1736/RobotCasserole2024/tree/main/RobotCode).
  
## 3. LocalHost Website 
  Here is a link to the localhost website used for sims and robot testing.  Some minor updates have occured but otherwise it is the classic website.
  (Just a heads up you'll need running code in simulation for the link to work.)
  [Super cool people click this link (Totally not a virus)](http://localhost:5805/)

## 4. Controller Mapping
  Here are our two mappings for our driver and operator controllers:
